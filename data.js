      "content": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">A Symbol of Pride and Cultural Resilience</span></h2><p>Mundari Bani is more than a writing system. For the Munda people of eastern India, it represents dignity, cultural survival, and intellectual independence.</p><p>Created by Rohidas Singh Nag in the mid-20th century, the script gave the Mundari language its own visual identity. It allowed the community not only to write words, but to preserve history, traditions, and stories in a form that truly belonged to them.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">The Challenge Before the Script</span></h2><p>Before Mundari Bani was developed, Mundari speakers relied on:</p><p></p><ul><li>Roman script</li><li>Odia script</li><li>Devanagari script</li></ul><p></p><p>These systems were not designed for the unique sounds of the Mundari language. As a result:</p><p></p><ul><li>Pronunciation was often distorted.</li><li>Spellings were inconsistent.</li><li>Teaching the language became difficult.</li><li>Written literature lacked uniformity.</li></ul><p></p><p>This mismatch made it harder to preserve and promote the language effectively.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">The Beginning of a Vision (1949)</span></h2><p>In 1949, Rohidas Singh Nag began designing a script specifically for Mundari. He carefully studied the sounds of his mother tongue and started sketching letters that would accurately reflect its phonetic structure.</p><p>Rather than rushing the process, he refined the script gradually. Each letter was adjusted and improved over time to ensure clarity and precision.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Growth and Standardization</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1953 – Expansion</span></p><p>By 1953, the alphabet had expanded as Nag improved the sound system and refined the character shapes.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">1980 – Standard Form Established</span></p><p>In 1980, the script was standardized with 27 primary letters. This step made the writing system simpler, systematic, and ready for wider use in education and publication.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">2008 – Community Refinement</span></p><p>In 2008, community organizations contributed to further improvements. The script was adjusted to enhance readability and learning efficiency, ensuring it met modern educational needs.</p><h2>Structural Features of the Script</h2><p>Mundari Bani stands out because of its thoughtful and independent design.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Independent Origin</span></p><p>The script is original. It is not borrowed or adapted from other Indian writing systems.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">One Sound, One Letter</span></p><p>Each character corresponds clearly to a specific Mundari sound. This reduces confusion and maintains pronunciation accuracy.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Simple and Learnable</span></p><p>With 27 letters, the system is straightforward and suitable for learners of all ages.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Adaptable Format</span></p><p>The script functions effectively in handwriting, print, and digital formats.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Educational Transformation</span></h2><p>The introduction of Mundari Bani in schools across parts of Odisha marked a major turning point.</p><p>By the early 2000s:</p><p></p><ul><li>Children began learning in their mother tongue.</li><li>Textbooks were developed in Mundari.</li><li>Oral traditions were documented in written form.</li><li>Cultural pride among younger generations increased.</li></ul><p></p><p>The script became a foundation for stronger education and community confidence.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Digital Recognition and Unicode Inclusion</span></h2><p>A historic milestone occurred in 2021–2022 when Mundari Bani—also known as Nag Mundari—was added to the Unicode Standard.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold;\">Unicode Block: U+1E4D0–U+1E4FF</span></p><p>This inclusion allows the script to be used on:</p><p></p><ul><li>Computers</li><li>Smartphones</li><li>Websites</li><li>Digital archives</li><li>Academic platforms</li></ul><p></p><p>Unicode recognition ensures the script’s survival in the modern technological era.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Part of a Broader Indigenous Movement</span></h2><p>Mundari Bani stands alongside other indigenous scripts from eastern India, including:</p><p></p><ul><li>Ol Chiki</li><li>Warang Citi</li></ul><p></p><p>These scripts share a common goal: preserving tribal languages and strengthening cultural identity in the face of assimilation.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Present Status and Future Prospects</span></h2><p>Today, Mundari Bani continues to grow through:</p><p></p><ul><li>Academic research</li><li>Community initiatives</li><li>Digital integration</li><li>Educational programs</li></ul><p></p><p>While full institutional adoption remains an ongoing effort, the progress achieved so far is significant. From handwritten sketches to global digital recognition, the script’s journey reflects dedication and resilience.</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Conclusion</span></h2><p>Mundari Bani is not merely a technical invention. It is a powerful expression of cultural survival and self-determination.</p><p>It captures the true sound of the Mundari language, strengthens education, and ensures relevance in the digital age. In an era where many indigenous languages face decline, Mundari Bani stands as a lasting example of how a script can become a symbol of hope, identity, and continuity.</p>"

      "content": "<h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Introduction</span></h2><p>Rohidas Singh Nag (5 February 1934 – 30 December 2012) was an Indian linguist, writer, and poet best known as the inventor of the Mundari Bani script. He dedicated his life to preserving and promoting the Mundari language and is respectfully known as “Ol Guru” among his community.</p><p>His work gave the Mundari language its own writing system and strengthened the cultural identity of the Munda people.</p><p>---</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Early Life</span></h2><p>Rohidas Singh Nag was born on 5 February 1934 in Chandua village, Mayurbhanj district, in present-day Odisha. He grew up in a tribal region where Mundari was widely spoken but did not have its own standardized script.</p><p>From a young age, he showed deep interest in language and culture.</p><p>---</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Early Innovation: Creation of Mundari Bani (1949)</span></h2><p>In 1949, while still a school student, Nag began developing what would later become:</p><p>Mundari Bani</p><p>He first wrote the alphabet on the walls of his school using clay. This marked the beginning of his lifelong effort to create a proper writing system for the Mundari language.</p><p>Why This Was Important</p><p></p><ul><li>He was still a student at the time.</li><li>He studied the sounds of the Mundari language carefully.</li><li>He wanted to avoid using Roman, Odia, or Devanagari scripts.</li></ul><p></p><p>This early effort laid the foundation for a complete and independent script.</p><p>---</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Development of the Script</span></h2><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(27, 67, 50);\">1953 – Expansion</span></p><p>In 1953, he expanded and improved the original alphabet. He refined the shapes of the letters and improved sound representation.</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(27, 67, 50);\">1980 – Standardization</span></p><p>After years of improvement, Nag finalized the script in 1980. He simplified the alphabet and selected 27 standard letters for regular use.</p><p>In the same year, he presented the script to the then Chief Minister of Odisha, J. B. Patnaik.</p><p>He also submitted a formal memorandum requesting constitutional recognition for the Munda language. This was an important step toward official acceptance.</p><p>---</p><p><span style=\"font-weight: bold; color: rgb(27, 67, 50);\">1999 – National Appeal</span></p><p>In 1999, Rohidas Singh Nag and other activists submitted a memorandum to the President of India. They requested that the Mundari language be granted constitutional recognition.</p><p>This showed that Nag was not only a script inventor but also a strong advocate for language rights and indigenous recognition at the national level.</p><p>---</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Educational and Cultural Impact</span></h2><p>By 2004, several schools in Odisha had started using Mundari Bani for teaching. This helped:</p><p></p><ul><li>Promote mother-tongue education</li><li>Preserve cultural heritage</li><li>Encourage written literature in Mundari</li></ul><p></p><p>The script became a symbol of pride and identity for the Munda community.</p><p>---</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Digital Recognition</span></h2><p>The script, also known as Nag Mundari, was officially added to the Unicode Standard in 2021–2022. This inclusion allows the script to be used in digital platforms, computers, and smartphones.</p><p>This ensured that Mundari Bani entered the modern digital era.</p><p>---</p><h2><span style=\"color: rgb(45, 106, 79);\">Legacy</span></h2><p>Rohidas Singh Nag passed away on 30 December 2012 at the age of 78. However, his contribution continues to influence language preservation movements.</p><p>Today, he is remembered as:</p><p></p><ul><li>The inventor of Mundari Bani</li><li>A protector of tribal linguistic heritage</li><li>A leader in the Mundari language movement</li></ul><p></p><p>His work remains one of the most important achievements in the history of indigenous languages in India.</p><p>---</p>"
